# SkullCreator
This library was forked from: https://github.com/deanveloper/SkullCreator. With the intention to
improve its performance where possible and add support to more versions starting at 1.8.

**Supported versions: 1.8 (might work on 1.7, haven't tested yet) and newer.**
**The current version was only test on the versions: 1.8, 1.12 and 1.18.1. If you want to help, fell free to test it on 
more versions. PRs are welcome.**

## Usage
Since this library was modified for my personal usage, I currently have no intention in teaching people that don't know
how to use it. But if you want a gist of how the library works, you can find an example in the examples' folder which 
should help you get started.

## Installation
To use this library, you can either copy the source code from repo and put it in your project, or you can get it through
JitPack. Head out to https://jitpack.io/#alisson0022/SkullCreator to see some tutorials.

And here are some website that will provide texture URLs and base64 encoded strings for you to use with the library:
